# Traffic-light-controller
ðŸ§  Project Objective:  To design a digital logic circuit that controls traffic lights at a road intersection using a Finite State Machine (FSM), implemented in Verilog or VHDL.

âš™ Why This Project?
It simulates real-world embedded control systems.
Teaches FSM design, synchronous logic, state transitions, and timing-based controlâ€”essential concepts in VLSI frontend.

ðŸ›£ Project Scenario:
A standard 4-way intersection with Red, Yellow, and Green lights for each direction. The controller will:
Cycle through each direction with proper timing.
Include Yellow transitions between Red and Green.
Optionally respond to pedestrian push-buttons or sensor inputs (like vehicle detection).
